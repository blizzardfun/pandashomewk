Analyzing the Data for the Heroes of Pymoli Game
Carol Thompson
       I looked at the data in the three primary areas involved in this assignment and came up with trends
 and directions the manufacturer of this game should consider 

       Looking at gender, the male group is obviously the largest but considering how much is spent per 
person between the female and other group both spend 40-50 cents more per person than the males. That means 
the female and other group is an area to consider for profitable growth. 
       Considering age, the three ranges from 15-29 are clearly the prime market and when looking at spending 
per person there is no clear difference in an age group to motivate targeting a group outside this age range 
for growth. That means this game company should clearly focus marketing on the 15-29 age group.
       For popularity of items, given that the average price of an item is $3.05 it is interesting that the 
most popular items are mostly above this. The most popular item being priced at $4.23 or more than a dollar 
above the average. There are more items available at a lower price, but those items are not the most popular. 
For further development this company should consider more items in the higher price range.
